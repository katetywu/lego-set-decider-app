# Lego Set Decider App
The Lego Set Decider App will help users decide what sets they would be interested in based on 5 seperate criterias (piece count, difficulty, rating, year produced, and cost). Our tool will give the user an option of five different sets that are the "nearest neighbor" for the users input. The user can utilize our tool to either combine different sets to build a new model (MOC "my own creation") or purchse sets similar to their own and follow building instructions.
